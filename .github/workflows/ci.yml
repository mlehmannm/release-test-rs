  # Disable incremental compilation.
  #
  # Incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle,
  # as it lets the compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. However,
  # on CI, we're not making small edits; we're almost always building the entire
  # project from scratch. Thus, incremental compilation on CI actually
  # introduces *additional* overhead to support making future builds
  # faster...but no future builds will ever occur in any given CI environment.
  #
  # See https://matklad.github.io/2021/09/04/fast-rust-builds.html#ci-workflow
  # for details.
